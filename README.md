# Codeforces Solutions

I took part in contests as well as solved interesting problems since high school days.
In this repository, you will find some of my solutions that may help you a problem you are stuck on.

I have used snake_case variable naming, 4 spaces for indentation.

So far I have added solutions for:

- Problem A: [938A](https://codeforces.com/contest/938/problem/A),

- Problem B:
- Problem C:
- Problem D:

You can also find my c++ template [here](https://github.com/JubayerJoy/Codeforces-Solutions/template.cpp).

You can open a PR if you find any mistakes. Contributions are welcome as well :smile:

Thanks!
