# Codeforces Solutions

I took part in contests as well as solved interesting problems since high school days.
In this repository, you will find some of my solutions that may help you a problem you are stuck on.

I have used snake_case variable naming, 4 spaces for indentation.

So far I have added solutions for:


<table>
    <th>
        <td> Problems Sovled</td>
    </th>
    <tr>
       <td colspan = "2"> Problem A </td>
       <td colspan = "2"> Problem B </td>
       <td colspan = "2"> Problem C </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
       <td> Id </td>
       <td> Solution</td>
       <td> Id </td>
       <td> Solution</td>
       <td> Id </td>
       <td> Solution</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    [938A][p1]
                </ul>
            </li>
        </td>
        <td>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    [solution][s1]
                </ul>
            </li>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

You can also find my c++ template [here](https://github.com/JubayerJoy/Codeforces-Solutions/blob/master/template.cpp).

You can open a PR if you find any mistakes. Contributions are welcome as well :smile:

Thanks!
