# Codeforces Solutions

I took part in contests as well as solved interesting problems since high school days.
In this repository, you will find some of my solutions that may help you a problem you are stuck on.

I have used snake_case variable naming, 4 spaces for indentation.

So far I have added solutions for:

## Problem A
