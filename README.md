# Codeforces Solutions

I took part in contests as well as solved interesting problems since high school days.
In this repository, you will find some of my solutions that may help you a problem you are stuck on.

I have used snake_case variable naming, 4 spaces for indentation.

So far I have added solutions for:

## Problem A

| Id    | Problem Name | Solution | Type | Difficulty  |
| --    | ------------ | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| [938A](https://codeforces.com/contest/938/problem/A) | Word Correction | [Solution](https://github.com/JubayerJoy/Codeforces-Solutions/blob/master/Codes/938A%20Word%20Correction.cpp) | Implementation | Easy |


You can also find my c++ template [here](https://github.com/JubayerJoy/Codeforces-Solutions/blob/master/template.cpp).

You can open a issue if you find any mistakes, contributions are welcome as well :blackheart:

Thanks!
